# PTT-init0

## Introduction
A simple software with MVC design pattern to  manage  the  employment,  training  and  payment  of part time teaching staff at a university or other such educational or training establishment. <br/>

Before the start of each term or semester, the class directors produce a list of teachingrequirements which we must try and fill. Our administrator will then attempt to findsuitable staff and organise training for them. All teaching requests must be approved bythe PTT Director. <br/>

## Emviroment setup
- Java SE 12
- JSON in Java, the URL: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20190722
- user guideline to help the operation of the system (details in the Appendix including user accounts)
- The database file of data in models is in “model.json”
Quick operation of the system: in the command line mode, execute: 
```
java -jar PTT.jar
```

## Design Principles
According to SOLID design principle, the MVC (Model–view–controller) design pattern was applied and each class has single responsibilities.For views package, the classes are design as static singletons. They are design purely as user interaction for separation of concerns (SoC). The user system and user data are separated into independent to be scaled up for more secure user management system. <br/>

For database package, the models are converted into JSON format to be stored into a single JSON file. The database is designed as static classes without coupling so that it could be scaled up into NoSQL document database for a distributed system in the second release. For example, MongoDB supports data stored as JSON format for large system design. <br/>


- For controllers packages:
  - Controller contains general methods for controllers packages.
  - Validator contains methods for input validation and scanners.
  - MenuController controls the overall procedures according to user inputs.

- For database package:
  - Database: Database object write and reads a file into model.json.
  - Object2Json is called by database object to convert objects to JSON format when saving data into the database.
  - Json2Object is called by database object to convert JSON and call constructors to recreate objects when loading data from the database.

- For views package:
  - DisplayInfo prints simple print method to display information for users.
  - MenuView prints the user menu.
  - Header prints the header of each menu.
  - UserSystem prints information for UserSystem in the model.
  - View contains some general method called by other objects in views package.

- For models package:
  - Model contains general methods for models package, as well as PTT system object and user system object.
  - PttSystem contains teachers' data and a list of RequirementList
  - UserSystem contains a list of users and is responsible for login, logout and registration.
  - RequirementList contains courses of the requirement set by course directors.

- For models.users package:
  - User stores user identification information such as username, password and user role in PTT system (i.e. The user is administrator, PTT director, course director or teacher.)
  - Teacher is inherited from user class, which contains the teacher's training status and courses.
